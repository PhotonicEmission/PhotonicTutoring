This was a Triumph
I'm making a note here: "Huge success!"
It's hard to overstate my satisfaction
Appeture Science
We do what we must because we can
For the good of all of us
Except the ones who are dead
But there's no use crying over every mistake
You just keep on trying till you run out of cake
And the science gets done
And you make a neat gun for the people who are still alive
